# Castle ActiveRecord

<img align="right" src="docs/images/castle-logo.png">

The **Castle ActiveRecord** project is an implementation of the [ActiveRecord pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record) for .NET. The ActiveRecord pattern consists on instance properties representing a record in the database, instance methods acting on that specific record and static methods acting on all records.

See the [documentation](docs/README.md).
